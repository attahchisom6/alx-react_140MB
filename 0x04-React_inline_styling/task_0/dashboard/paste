Thanks for your assurance Mr Andrew Ngunboa.
One would only have to imagine a scenario where a cohort 9 and a cohort 10 graduate  found themselves looking for a job in the same organization and at the same time; On certigicate presentation, i beg to understand with all due respect that even you will question the veracity and validity of the certificate presented by the cohort 9 counterpart.
Regarding the certificate u sent us on Tuesday, i gave it to my sister to print out for me a physical copy, but she refused on the pretext that the cerificate look so canvassed and surreal for it to be true, she feared she might be arrested on charges such as a "yahoo guy" (a trend currenrly going on in the area we live now, and by soldiers for that matter). I have asked fellow SE regarding this issue and they too are of the same view; In the end i have not gone to print it out. What if i brave it and print it out and perchance encountered a soldier? unlike my brother who got arrested on the same charges of "yahoo guys" and he only has to call my sister's husband who he is currently working for b4 he got released, who do i call? my father? a mentor? when neither a verification link nor a barcode, nor an email or working phone number is on the cerificate to prove matters.
Pls understand that this certificate is not just a matter of authenticity and originality to show a prospective employer, it also a matter of SECURITY for some of us in some part of Africa, were authenticity is demanded down to the driving license. Carrying a certificate like the one u issued us is dangerous. pls reconsider and fufil ur PROMISE Sir. Thanks
